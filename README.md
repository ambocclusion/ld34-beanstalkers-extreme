# Beanstalkers Extreme: Takin' Out The Trash

Ever have some really cruddy neighbors? Have they ever thrown their trash on your lawn and you've had to clean it the next day? This guy too. Except his neighbors are giants, and the trash is leaving craters in his village. It's time to do something about it. 

This game was made for Ludum Dare 34, a worldwide [72-hour game jam](http://ludumdare.com/compo/about-ludum-dare/).

We'd really appreciate your support. [Please play and rate our game here!](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-34/?uid=58187) Thank you ^_^

We used both themes, _Two Button Controls_ and _Growth_. For the most part, we finished except a few little things such as some missing music.

Beanstalkers Extreme is built with Unity, so it is cross-platform. We currently support web and Android, though Android runs slower right now. More platforms coming soon. [See our Ludum Dare page for links](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-34/?uid=58187).
