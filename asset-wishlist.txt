falling person?
giant baby
BABY SLAMMM
carrying-babay person (angle tbd)

Cutscenery (still-images):
An opening screen(s) that convey the concept or narrative. Can be comic.
A scene for when the little man is discovered while sneaking (to-be-determined what happens)
A scene for running away with the babay (with angry adult giant in tow? could be off-screen)
Epilogue scene with a funny conclusion
WORLD EXPLOSION?
Planting the beanstalk

Lower priority:
Something at the top of the beanstalk (a house in the clouds?) This will come into view when we approach the top, so it will be from the same perspective as we view the little person.
